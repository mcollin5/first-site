Introduction
I am an Activist and Political Organizer living in Asheville, North Carolina.  I feel passionate about the ongoing fight for social justice in our current the local, national, and global systems. I live for the liberation of all people.

Where I am from

I originally hail from New Jersey.  I anntened The Unitversity of Maryland and recieved my undergraduate degree in Political Science.  After college I spent two years serving as an AmeriCorps member and through my experiences travelling and participating in culturally and economically diverse communities gained an more true education in what truly means and requires to live, work, and subsist as an American today.  I hope to learn from what I have experienced in order to build relationships and structures which help to lead to our collective liberation as local, national, and global citizens.  

About me:

I am a pretty simple guy.  I like to read, write, meditate, go to the movies, strum my gutair, and spend time with people I care about.  My favorite pass time is walking and my favorite place to walk is in the forest and wildernes of Sourthern Appalachia.

My dream job?

I try to live my dreams everyday.

What music have I been listening to lately?

I had been getting funky with Ani DiFranco and being blown away by the masterful Ludovico Einaudi.
